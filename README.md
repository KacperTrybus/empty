Learning localStorage:
1. Refractored gallery using npm instead of cdn for libraries (lightbox)
2. Movie player that saves current playtime and restores the video using localStorage after refreshing the page
3. Form inputs are saved in localStorage and refreshing the page doesn't affect them, upon submitting the values are logged, the storage is cleared and form is refreshed
